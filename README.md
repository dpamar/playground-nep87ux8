# BrainFuck part 10 - RPN calc tool

The goal of this playground is to implement a calc tool based on reverse polish notation (RPN)

At the end of this playground, you should be able to
* write basic operations in RPN
* write BF code to interpret this RPN
* extends an existing program by adding more and more cases

Have fun !
